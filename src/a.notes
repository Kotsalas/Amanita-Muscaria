1. delete or randomize the spawn of the rods

At some point the code should save player data on a new file and be able to retrieve them
to check the state of the player

Name of the game. Something with AMANITA MUSCARIA (also called fly agaria) since its the type of the mushroom that the hero is

This type of mushroom has hallucinogenic properties. These properties are a large and diverse
class of psychoactive drugs that can produce altered states of conciousness, characterized
by major alternations in thought, mood and perception as well as other changes.
Most hallucinogens can be categorizedas either being psychedelics, dissociatives or deliriants.
Although poisonous. death due to poisoning from amanita muscaria ingestion is quite rare.
So the hero can peek up three abilities.

-Ability of thought:
For a short period of time show the correct path for the player to follow in order to get out of the maze
but after that reverse the keys (left becomes right, up becomes down and the other way).

-Ability of mood:
For a period of time move faster but you have blurred vision.

-Ability of perception:
The hero basically sees another riality. Therefor the player still sees the actuall map
but the hero sees hes own map (cahnge the position of the walls).

Consuming abilities increases the sanity of the hero leading to ovrdose. The playe will be able to collect crystals in order to make medicine for their sanity and prevent overdose.




Since your main character is an Amanita Muscaria mushroom, the story could revolve around a mystical forest where reality is unstable due to the mushroom’s unique abilities. Maybe the world itself is shifting, and the protagonist must learn to control their powers to restore balance.

🌿 Story Idea: "The Shifting Forest"
The forest has been thrown into chaos—mazes twist on their own, puzzles rearrange, and creatures act strangely. The elders of the fungal village believe this is because the “Great Mycelium”, a vast underground network that connects all mushrooms, has been disturbed.

Your hero, a young Amanita Muscaria, has just begun awakening their abilities to alter thought, mood, and perception. To fix the world, they must navigate the shifting forest, solve puzzles, and master their abilities before they lose themselves in the distortions.

The NPCs in the first three levels could introduce the hero to this world and their abilities in a quirky, mysterious, and sometimes unreliable way (since they are part of the shifting reality too).

2. swamp
3. undeground or graveyard (implement torch and flickering in the light)
